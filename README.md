- 2019-10-07 - [Car Datasheet (1970-1982)](https://github.com/obrunet/Web_Scraping_Projects/blob/master/2019-10-07-car_datasheet/auto_mpg.html) - Basics of scraping using bs4, first try with [a notebook](https://github.com/obrunet/Web_Scraping_Projects/blob/master/2019-10-07-car_datasheet/scraping%20data.ipynb), then using [a robust script written with pycharm](https://github.com/obrunet/Web_Scraping_Projects/blob/master/2019-10-07-car_datasheet/last_scraper_version.py), and finally an [exploratory data analysis](https://github.com/obrunet/Web_Scraping_Projects/blob/master/2019-10-07-car_datasheet/making_scraped_data_usable.ipynb) with pandas and seaborn
- 2019-10-20 - [Pokemon's database](https://pokemondb.net/) - a little more complicated scraping task using bs4, different first tries are made with the notebooks in the directory but the main and final script with pycharm is [HERE](https://github.com/obrunet/Web_Scraping_Projects/blob/master/2019-10-20-pokemon_db/main.py). Then i've started to make a [statisctical analysis](https://github.com/obrunet/Web_Scraping_Projects/blob/master/2019-10-20-pokemon_db/pokemon_stats.ipynb) but it's uncomplete, i'll finished later if i've time :)
