    "If you're interested in learning new languages, it's important to be able to speak with a good accent, to understand speeches or discussions, read books but also to have enough vocabulary.  \n",
    "My English is not as fluent as it used to be, but i've decided to work on it. So the question : is how many words in a foreign language you need to know ? Well, [the CEFR English levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages) can provide the beginning of an answer :\n",
    "\n",

    "An article from BBC.com intitled \"[How many words do you need to speak a language?](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-44569277)\" can bring other explanations on the table : \n",
    "\"*[...] it is incredibly difficult for a language learner to ever know as many words as a native speaker.   \n",
    "Typically native speakers know 15,000 to 20,000 word families - or lemmas - in their first language.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*[...] So does someone who can hold a decent conversation in a second language know 15,000 to 20,000 words? Is this a realistic goal for our listener to aim for? Unlikely.*   \n",
    "\n",
    "*Prof Webb found that people who have been studying languages in a traditional setting - say French in Britain or English in Japan - often struggle to learn more than 2,000 to 3,000 words, even after years of study.*  \n",
    "\n",
    "*In fact, a study in Taiwan showed that after nine years of learning a foreign language half of the students failed to learn the most frequently-used 1,000 words.*   \n",
    "\n",
    "*And that is the key, the frequency with which the words you learn appear in day-to-day use in the language you're learning.*   \n",
    "\n",
    "*You don't need to know all of the words in a language [...]*   \n",
    "\n",
    "*So which words should we learn? Prof Webb says the most effective way to be able to speak a language quickly is to pick the 800 to 1,000 lemmas which appear most frequently in a language, and learn those.*   \n",
    "\n",
    "*If you learn only 800 of the most frequently-used lemmas in English, you'll be able to understand 75% of the language as it is spoken in normal life.*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "By searching the web for the most frequently used words, you can quickly arrive on the [OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/wordlists/oxford3000-5000) webpage :\n",

    "*The Oxford 5000 is an expanded core word list for advanced learners of English. ... the frequency of the words in the Oxford English Corpus, a database of over 2 billion words from different subject areas and contexts which covers British, American and world English.*\n",
